| `06/06/2023` | Mainly focused on Polynomial regressions and regularization techniques like Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet. Had to grab a book to refresh my knowledge and learn something new. Encountered a weird behaviour with polynomial regression with different datasets: on simple non-linear data it's performing ok, but on other (I used linear, but it shouldn't be an issue as far as I know.) the gradient explodes and so does the loss. Also, I'm getting a better hang of OOP and it's usefullness (inheritance is a godly feature!). |
